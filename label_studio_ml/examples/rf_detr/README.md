# RF-DETR ML Backend for Label Studio

Object detection using [RF-DETR](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr) (Roboflow) with support for **your own checkpoint**. This backend follows the [Label Studio ML backend guide](https://labelstud.io/guide/ml_create).

## Features

- Use pretrained COCO weights or **load your own trained checkpoint**
- Configurable model size: `nano`, `small`, `medium`, `large`
- Optional custom class names (e.g. for fine-tuned models)
- Outputs bounding boxes as Label Studio `RectangleLabels` for pre-annotations

## Labeling config

Your project should use **RectangleLabels** and **Image**:

```xml
<View>
  <Image name="image" value="$image"/>
  <RectangleLabels name="label" toName="image">
    <Label value="Person" background="green"/>
    <Label value="Car" background="blue"/>
  </RectangleLabels>
</View>
```

Label values must match the model’s class names (COCO or your `CLASSES_FILE`).

### Interactive pre-annotations

The backend supports **interactive pre-annotations**. Enable it in your project (e.g. **Settings → Machine Learning → Interactive pre-annotations**), then in the labeling config add a control that sends keypoints or a region:

- **KeypointLabels** (e.g. user clicks on the image): the backend returns only detections that **contain a positive keypoint** (and excludes boxes containing a **negative** keypoint, e.g. Alt+click). So the labeler can click on an object to “focus” predictions on that area.
- **RectangleLabels** used as a focus region: predictions are filtered to boxes that **overlap** that rectangle.

Example: add a KeypointLabels control bound to the same Image so the user can click to refine which boxes are shown. The `predict()` method receives this as `context` and filters results accordingly. With no context (e.g. first load), the backend returns all detections as usual.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CHECKPOINT_PATH` | Path to your custom `.pt` / `.pth` checkpoint. Omit to use pretrained COCO. | (none) |
| `MODEL_SIZE` | Must match the trained architecture: `nano`, `small`, `medium`, `base`, `large`. A folder named `rfdetr_large` is not enough — current `RFDETRLarge` is the 2026 weights (DINOv2-small / hidden 256). | `medium` |
| `CLASSES_FILE` | Path to class names: JSON array or newline-separated file. Omit for COCO. | (none) |
| `SCORE_THRESHOLD` | Confidence threshold 0–1 | `0.5` |
| `DEVICE` | `cpu` or `cuda` | `cuda` if available |
| `LABEL_STUDIO_URL` | Label Studio URL (for resolving image URLs) | — |
| `LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY` | Label Studio API key | — |

## Using your own checkpoint

1. Train or export your RF-DETR model (e.g. with [rf-detr training](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr)).
2. Place the checkpoint file on the server (e.g. `./data/models/checkpoint.pt`).
3. Set `CHECKPOINT_PATH` to that path (e.g. in `docker-compose.yml` or env).
4. If your model has custom classes, create a `CLASSES_FILE` (e.g. JSON `["class1","class2"]` or one class per line) and set `CLASSES_FILE` to its path.
5. Ensure the Label Studio labeling config uses the same label names as in `CLASSES_FILE`.

Checkpoint format: the backend expects a state dict (e.g. from `torch.save(model.state_dict(), path)` or a dict with a `"state_dict"` or `"model"` key). If your checkpoint layout differs, you may need to adjust loading in `model.py`.

## Run with Docker

```bash
cd label_studio_ml/examples/rf_detr
# Optional: put your checkpoint in ./data/models/checkpoint.pt and set CHECKPOINT_PATH in docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

Backend URL: `http://localhost:9090`. In Label Studio: **Settings → Model** and add this URL.

## Run without Docker

1. Install the [Label Studio ML backend](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-ml-backend#quickstart) and go to the repo root.

2. Create a virtualenv and install deps:

```bash
cd label_studio_ml/examples/rf_detr
pip install -r requirements-base.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set env vars (optional: `CHECKPOINT_PATH`, `CLASSES_FILE`, `LABEL_STUDIO_URL`, `LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY`, etc.).

4. Start the backend (from the `rf_detr` directory or pass the path to it):

```bash
label-studio-ml start . -p 9090
```

Or from the repo root:

```bash
label-studio-ml start label_studio_ml/examples/rf_detr -p 9090
```

5. In Label Studio, connect the model at `http://localhost:9090` (use `http://host.docker.internal:9090` if LS runs in Docker).

## Retrieve predictions for a large dataset

Do **not** use Data Manager → Retrieve Predictions for hundreds of images. Label Studio
serves that action as one request, nginx times out at 90s, and uWSGI kills the worker
at 91s. Predictions are saved only after the full batch finishes, so a timeout loses
all work.

Predict and save one task at a time:

```bash
export LABEL_STUDIO_URL=http://10.242.200.200:18080
export LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY=<token from Account & Settings → Access Token>
export ML_BACKEND_URL=http://10.242.200.200:9095
export PROJECT_ID=1
python3 retrieve_predictions.py
```

Safe to re-run: tasks that already have `RFDETRBackend-v0.0.1` are skipped.

If you must use the UI, select **50–80 tasks** per Retrieve Predictions click so each
request finishes under 90 seconds.

## Test

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pytest test_api.py -v
```
